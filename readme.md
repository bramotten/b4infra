So I like Incus. But `compose`s are the way...

TODO: remove root key on de34

TODO: consistently manage secrets / env keys, it's all tailscaled now so worry later

Add every exposed service to Authentik, internally link like http://100.102.130.116:12380. 
On top of that you need to add to outpost. 
Then it still likes to be sticky..
